Hill Cipher in Python
This is a simple implementation of the Hill Cipher, a matrix-based encryption technique.

How It Works
Encryption: Converts plaintext into numbers, multiplies by a key matrix, and applies modulo 26.
Decryption: Uses the inverse of the key matrix (mod 26) to retrieve the original text.

Requirements
Python 3
NumPy
