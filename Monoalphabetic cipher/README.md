# Overview
This Python script implements a simple random substitution cipher. It generates a shuffled version of the alphabet and uses it to encrypt and decrypt a given plaintext.

# Modules Used
1.string: Provides predefined character sets (e.g., lowercase letters).
2.random: Generates random values for shuffling the alphabet.

# Code Explanation
```python
import string  # Import the string module to access predefined character sets
import random  # Import the random module for generating random values

# Create a list of all lowercase letters (a-z)
l = list(string.ascii_lowercase)

# Initialize an empty list to store the shuffled letters
l1 = []

# Loop until l1 contains all unique letters from l
while len(l1) < len(l):
    a = random.choice(l)  # Pick a random letter from the original list

    if a not in l1:  # Ensure uniqueness before adding to the new list
        l1.append(a)

# Print the original list of lowercase letters
print(l)

# Print the randomly shuffled list with unique letters
print(l1)

# Take plaintext input from the user
pt = input("Enter pt: ")

# Initialize an empty string for ciphertext
ct = ""

# Encrypt the plaintext using the randomized letter mapping
for i in pt:
    ct += l1[l.index(i)]  # Find the index of the letter in the original list and replace it with the corresponding letter from l1

# Print the encrypted text
print("ct:", ct)

# Initialize an empty string to store the decrypted text
pt = ""

# Decrypt the ciphertext back to plaintext
for i in ct:
    pt += l[l1.index(i)]  # Find the index of the encrypted letter in l1 and replace it with the corresponding letter from l

# Print the decrypted text (original plaintext)
print("pt:", pt)
```
# Explanation
1.Alphabet Mapping:
 a.The script creates a list l containing all lowercase letters (a-z).
 b.A new list l1 is generated by randomly shuffling l while ensuring unique values.
2.Encryption Process:
  a.The script takes user input as plaintext (pt).
  b.It replaces each letter with the corresponding letter from l1 using the index from l.
  c.The encrypted text (ct) is printed.
3.Decryption Process:
  a.The script reconstructs the original text by mapping each character in ct back to l using the index from l1.
  b.The decrypted text (pt) is printed, verifying successful encryption and decryption.

# Example Usage
```
Enter pt: hello
ct: xyzab
pt: hello
```
# Notes
1.The random substitution ensures encryption is different each time the script runs.
2.It only works for lowercase letters; modifications are needed for uppercase letters, digits, or special characters.
3.The same mapping must be preserved for consistent encryption and decryption.
