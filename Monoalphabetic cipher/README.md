Monoalphabetic Cipher in Python
This Python script implements a Monoalphabetic Cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is substituted with a unique, randomly shuffled letter from the alphabet.

How It Works:
A shuffled version of the English lowercase alphabet is generated.
The user inputs a plaintext message.
Each letter in the plaintext is replaced with its corresponding letter from the shuffled list to generate the ciphertext.
The ciphertext is then decrypted back to the original plaintext using the same mapping.
