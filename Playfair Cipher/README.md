Playfair Cipher Implementation in Python
This Python script implements the Playfair Cipher, a classical encryption technique that enciphers pairs of letters based on a 5x5 matrix generated using a given key.

How It Works
Creating the Playfair Matrix

The key is processed to remove duplicate letters.
The English alphabet (excluding J) is appended to the key.
A 5x5 matrix is constructed from the key and remaining alphabet letters.
Encryption Process

The plaintext is converted to uppercase and spaces are removed.
If J appears, it is replaced with I.
If the length of plaintext is odd, an "X" is appended as padding.
The plaintext is split into letter pairs and encrypted using the Playfair Cipher rules:
Same row â†’ Replace with letters to the right (wrap around if needed).
Same column â†’ Replace with letters below (wrap around if needed).
Rectangle rule â†’ Swap column positions of the letters.
Decryption Process

The ciphertext is processed using the same Playfair matrix.
Instead of shifting right/down, letters are shifted left/up.
The decrypted text is returned.
